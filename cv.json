    </br>
    He does not fit any text-book 'personality type'. He is well-rounded, grounded and determined and turns his hand to anything in his pursuit of understanding and overcoming a challenge.
    He is joy to work with and an asset to any team; I would be delighted to work/learn with him again!"
